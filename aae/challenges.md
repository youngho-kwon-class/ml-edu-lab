# 🧠 AAE Challenge Tasks

Dive deeper into Adversarial Autoencoders with these structured challenges.

---

## 🎓 Beginner (Undergraduate Level)

- ✅ Implement a basic AAE on MNIST using fully connected layers.
- 🔍 Visualize the latent space using PCA or t-SNE.
- 📊 Compare reconstruction quality with a vanilla autoencoder.

---

## 🧪 Intermediate (Graduate Level)

- 🧠 Replace the encoder/decoder with convolutional layers.
- 🔄 Experiment with different prior distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform).
- 🧪 Modify the adversarial loss function and observe its effect.
- 📊 Track discriminator accuracy during training and interpret its behavior.

---

## 🚀 Advanced (Research Level)

- 🧬 Implement Conditional AAE using label information.
- 🧠 Explore semi-supervised learning with AAE.
- 📚 Reproduce results from the original AAE paper or related research.
- 🔍 Compare AAE with VAE and GAN in terms of latent space structure and sample quality.
- 🧪 Apply AAE to anomaly detection or domain adaptation tasks.

> 💡 Tip: Try combining AAE with other techniques like attention or contrastive learning.
