# 🧠 AAE Challenge Tasks

Dive deeper into Adversarial Autoencoders with these structured challenges.

---

## 🎓 Beginner (Undergraduate Level)

- ✅ Review the architecture of AAE and explain the role of each component (encoder, decoder, discriminator).
- 🔍 Modify the latent space dimension and observe its effect on reconstruction quality.
- 📊 Compare AAE with a vanilla autoencoder in terms of loss and output samples.
- 🧠 Describe the difference between adversarial loss and reconstruction loss.

---

## 🧪 Intermediate (Graduate Level)

- 🧠 Visualize the latent space using t-SNE (already implemented in the notebook).
- 🔄 Experiment with different prior distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform).
- 🧪 Replace the encoder/decoder with convolutional layers.
- 📊 Track discriminator accuracy during training and interpret its behavior.

## 🚀 Advanced (Research Level)

- 🧬 Implement Conditional AAE using label information.
- 🧠 Explore semi-supervised learning with AAE.
- 📚 Reproduce results from the original AAE paper or related research.
- 🔍 Compare AAE with VAE and GAN in terms of latent space structure and sample quality.
- 🧪 Apply AAE to anomaly detection or domain adaptation tasks.
