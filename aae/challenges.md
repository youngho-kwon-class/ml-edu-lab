# 🧠 VAE Challenge Tasks

Here are some suggested tasks to deepen your understanding of Variational Autoencoders:

## 🔍 Conceptual Challenges
- Explain the role of the KL divergence term in the VAE loss function.
- Compare VAE with traditional autoencoders: What are the key differences?

## 🧪 Coding Challenges
- Modify the latent space dimension and observe how it affects reconstruction quality.
- Train the VAE on a different dataset (e.g., Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10).
- Implement a conditional VAE (CVAE) using class labels.

## 🎨 Visualization Tasks
- Visualize the latent space using t-SNE or PCA.
- Generate new samples by interpolating between two latent vectors.

## 🚀 Advanced Extensions
- Try using convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers.
- Explore β-VAE: Introduce a weighting factor to the KL term and analyze its effect.

> 💡 Tip: Document your findings and share them with your peers or instructors!
