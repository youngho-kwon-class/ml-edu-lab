# 🎓 Machine Learning Education Lab

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks for learning and experimenting with machine learning models.  
It focuses on generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

## How to Use

All notebooks are designed to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  
Click the links below to launch each notebook in your own Colab environment.
