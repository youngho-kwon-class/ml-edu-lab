# 🎓 Machine Learning Education Lab

Welcome to the Machine Learning Education Lab!  
This repository provides interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to help you learn, implement, and visualize various machine learning models — especially generative models like VAE, GAN, and AAE.

## 🚀 How to Use

All notebooks are optimized for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but they can also be run locally using Jupyter Notebook.

To get started:
1. Click on a notebook link in the **Contents** section.
2. Open it in Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" badge (if available).
3. Run the cells sequentially and follow the instructions inside each notebook.

## 📂 Contents

Each lab focuses on a specific generative model and includes:
- Conceptual overview
- Implementation walkthrough
- Visualization tools

Available labs:
- [VAE Lab](vae/README.md) – Variational Autoencoders
- [GAN Lab](gan/README.md) – Generative Adversarial Networks
- [AAE Lab](aae/README.md) – Adversarial Autoencoders
- [Adam vs. AdamP](adamp-vs-adam-benchmark/README.md)- Benchmark CIFAR10 vs. FASIONMNIST
- [NMT Comparison](en2fr-transformer-comparison/README.md)-Comparison of Custom Transformer and Pretrained Model for EN→FR Translation

  
## 🛠️ Environment

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (recommended) or local Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch 1.13+

If you're running the notebooks locally, make sure to install the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- torchvision (for image datasets)

✅ On Google Colab, most dependencies are pre-installed. Just run the setup cells in each notebook to ensure compatibility.


## 🎯 Objectives

By working through these labs, you will:
- Understand the theoretical foundations of generative models
- Implement models from scratch using PyTorch
- Experiment with architectures and hyperparameters
- Visualize latent spaces, reconstructions, and training dynamics
- Build intuition for how generative models learn and generalize
