# 🧠 VAE Challenge Tasks

Explore and extend your understanding of Variational Autoencoders through these tiered challenges.

---

## 🎓 Beginner (Undergraduate Level)

- ✅ Implement a basic VAE using fully connected layers on MNIST.
- 🔍 Visualize input reconstructions and compare them to original images.
- 📊 Plot the loss components: reconstruction loss vs KL divergence.
- 🧠 Explain the role of the KL divergence term in the VAE objective.

---

## 🧪 Intermediate (Graduate Level)

- 🧠 Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers (Conv-VAE).
- 🔄 Experiment with different latent space dimensions and observe their effect.
- 🧪 Train the VAE on a different dataset (e.g., Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10).
- 📊 Visualize the latent space using t-SNE or PCA.
- 🧠 Implement β-VAE and analyze how varying β affects disentanglement.

---

## 🚀 Advanced (Research Level)

- 🧬 Implement Conditional VAE (CVAE) using class labels.
- 🧠 Explore disentangled representations: Try FactorVAE or DIP-VAE.
- 📚 Reproduce results from a recent VAE-related paper.
- 🔍 Compare VAE with GAN and AAE in terms of sample quality and latent space structure.
- 🧪 Apply VAE to non-image domains (e.g., text, tabular data, or time-series).
- 🧠 Investigate posterior collapse and propose mitigation strategies.

> 💡 Tip: Document your experiments and share insights with peers or instructors.
