# 🧠 VAE Challenge Tasks

Explore and extend your understanding of Variational Autoencoders through these tiered challenges.

---

## 🎓 Beginner (Undergraduate Level)

- ✅ Review the architecture of VAE and explain the role of the encoder, decoder, and latent space.
- 🔍 Modify the latent space dimension and observe its effect on reconstruction quality.
- 📊 Compare VAE with a vanilla autoencoder in terms of loss and output samples.
- 🧠 Describe the role of the KL divergence term in the VAE objective.

---

## 🧪 Intermediate (Graduate Level)

- 🧠 Visualize the latent space using grid sampling (already implemented in the notebook).
- 🔄 Experiment with different latent space dimensions and analyze sample diversity.
- 🧪 Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers (Conv-VAE).
- 📊 Train the VAE on a different dataset (e.g., Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10).
- 🧠 Implement β-VAE and analyze how varying β affects disentanglement.

---

## 🚀 Advanced (Research Level)

- 🧬 Implement Conditional VAE (CVAE) using class labels.
- 🧠 Explore disentangled representations: Try FactorVAE or DIP-VAE.
- 📚 Reproduce results from a recent VAE-related paper.
- 🔍 Apply VAE to non-image domains (e.g., text, tabular data, or time-series).
- 🧠 Investigate posterior collapse and propose mitigation strategies.
- 🧪 Compare VAE with GAN and AAE in terms of sample quality and latent space structure.
