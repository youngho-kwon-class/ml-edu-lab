# 🧠 GAN Challenge Tasks

Explore and extend your understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks through these tiered challenges.

---

## 🎓 Beginner (Undergraduate Level)

- ✅ Review the architecture of GAN and explain the role of the generator and discriminator.
- 🔍 Modify the noise vector dimension and observe its effect on generated samples.
- 📊 Plot the loss curves of the generator and discriminator and interpret their trends.
- 🧠 Describe the concept of adversarial training and why it's challenging.

---

## 🧪 Intermediate (Graduate Level)

- 🧠 Visualize the latent space using t-SNE (already implemented in the notebook).
- 🔄 Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers (DCGAN).
- 🧪 Try different activation functions (e.g., LeakyReLU vs ReLU).
- 📊 Experiment with different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) and analyze convergence behavior.
- 🧠 Add noise to the discriminator input and observe its effect on training stability.

---

## 🚀 Advanced (Research Level)

- 🧬 Implement Conditional GAN (CGAN) using class labels.
- 🧠 Explore Mode Collapse: Design experiments to detect and mitigate it.
- 📚 Reproduce results from a recent GAN paper (e.g., StyleGAN, BigGAN).
- 🔍 Apply GAN to non-image data (e.g., tabular or time-series).
- 🧠 Compare GAN with other generative models like VAE or AAE in terms of sample diversity and latent space structure.
