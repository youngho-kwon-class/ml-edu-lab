# 🧠 GAN Challenge Tasks

Explore and extend your understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks through these tiered challenges.

---

## 🎓 Beginner (Undergraduate Level)

- ✅ Implement a basic GAN using fully connected layers on MNIST.
- 🔍 Visualize generated samples during training and compare them to real data.
- 📊 Plot the loss curves of the generator and discriminator.

---

## 🧪 Intermediate (Graduate Level)

- 🧠 Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers (DCGAN).
- 🔄 Experiment with different activation functions (e.g., LeakyReLU vs ReLU).
- 🧮 Try different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) and analyze convergence behavior.
- 🧪 Add noise to the discriminator input and observe its effect on training stability.

---

## 🚀 Advanced (Research Level)

- 🧬 Implement Conditional GAN (CGAN) using class labels.
- 🧠 Explore Mode Collapse: Design experiments to detect and mitigate it.
- 🧪 Apply GAN to non-image data (e.g., tabular or time-series).
- 📚 Read and reproduce results from a recent GAN paper (e.g., StyleGAN, BigGAN).
- 🧠 Compare GAN with other generative models like VAE or Flow-based models.

> 💡 Tip: Document your experiments and share insights with peers or instructors.
